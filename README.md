# differ

Alpha level experiment around a context-aware diffing tool

## Todo (if I ever have time)
- [ ] Add JSON mode
- [ ] Able to hide whitespace and prettier / eslint type changes
- [ ] Able to normalize prettier changes across both to detect the real changes
- [ ] Able to show only the parts that matter in a minified file
